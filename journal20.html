    <div id='entries'> <br> Week of 10.18.19 <br> -As we didn't have school this past Monday, I decided to make some banana bread. I had an inexplicable craving for this baked good, even though I haven't really thought about for a while until recently. My mom and I got the ingredients for the bread, including what I consider the essential additions, these being chocolate chips and walnuts. The banana bread actually turned out really well, despite my history with either underbaking or overbaking cakes. Overall it was a productive use of my day off and set a positive tone for the rest of this week. <br> <br> Week of 10.25.19 <br> -This week I was pretty productive, at least as far as Comp-Sci goes. I created my personal website (yes, the one you're reading now!) and made it publically accessable. Im really happy with it, as I know it is still in its really early stages. I had a bit of trouble pushing it since I already had my gecko thing on my github page. However, I worked this out and it is really cool to be able to show people my website on any device. I hope to clean it up and add some images to it soon, but overall I'm pleased with what I got done. <br> <br> Week of 11.1.19 <br> -Happy Halloween! I don't think I was quite as productive as last week, but I got some things done. I fixed some little glitches on the website and pushed it, so the current version is fully updated. I had a bit of trouble getting this to work, but for the time being I'm ok. Also, I've begun to work on adding coins to my rocket game. They are not currently fuctioning, so getting them to work is going to be my focus for the time being. <br> <br> Week of 11.8.19 <br> -My comp-sci highlight this week was definitely presenting at the Dalton Grows Up event along with some of my peers. I didn't feel like I had to put on an act or anything like that, which made it a lot easier to speak comfortably and confidently about my rocket game. During that event I was working on a prototype of a joystick for the game and I actually got it to work. I now have a more final version of the joystick, although it is not yet functional. Lastly, I have encorporated coins into the game, which was one of my goals for this week. I look forward to cleaning up the game more and maybe adding a "try again" button. <br> <br> Week of 11.15.19 <br> -
